# ADR-004: Realtime Data Channels (WIP)

[![hackmd-github-sync-badge](https://hackmd.io/iomfscGXR1ycI_67NrLvMw/badge)](https://hackmd.io/iomfscGXR1ycI_67NrLvMw)

## Abstract

The fundamental communication component across all Sonr nodes is the `channel`. By utilizing data and transport agnostic realtime streams between nodes, we effectively have realtime structured data transmission at any point in the world.

## Primer

The Sonr channel implementation requires prior knowledge of the following definitions before implementation.

### `multiaddr` 

Multiaddr's are self describing addresses that operate on any network protocol. They provide human-readable and efficient machine-readable representations. [The multiaddr spec](https://github.com/multiformats/multiaddr) by protocol labs provides further details about the mechanism.

### `gossip-sub`

The Sonr implementation follows the standard publish/subscribe model present with the modern web, with the caveat that it operates on a peer-to-peer node.
